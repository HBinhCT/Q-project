#### Task

There are **3** urns labeled **X**, **Y**, and **Z**.

* Urn **X** contains **4** red balls and **3** black balls.
* Urn **Y** contains **5** red balls and **4** black balls.
* Urn **Z** contains **4** red balls and **4** black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the **3** urns. What is the probability that, of the **3** balls drawn, **2** are red and **1** is black?

___

#### Answer: _17/42_

> Urn X has a 4/7 probability of giving a red ball
>
> Urn Y has a 5/9 probability of giving a red ball

> Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a red ball

> Urn Y has a 4/9 probability of giving a black ball
>
> Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a black ball
